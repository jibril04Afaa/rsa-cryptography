RSA procedure
- choose two large prime numbers for the key pair, 
which is difficult to factorize. the prime numbers must be selected 
randomly and with a substantial difference between them.

- calculate the product of the two numbers. the two numbers must be
kpet secret, while their product is public.

- the Carmechealsâ€™ totient function is calculated using p and q, 
and the integer e, whose value is used as the public exponent, 
is selected. Then the next step is calculating the value of d, 
which is used as the private exponent.

- public key = (product(n), public exponent(e))
